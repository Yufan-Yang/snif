Description: Variable selection methods specifically targeted toward
    interactions between predictor variables are limited. The 'snif' package
    provides an implementation of "Selection of Nonlinear Interactions by a
    Forward stepwise method" by Narisetty, Mukherjee et al (2091)
    <doi:10.1002/sim.8059>.  SINF incorporates nonlinearity of the predictors by
    introducing basis function expansions of the predictors and creates a
    forward selection path for main and interaction effects following the strong
    heredity principle (ie, interactions are present only when both the
    corresponding main effects are present). In addition to adding the basis
    functions for each predictor to account for nonlinearity, SNIF retains the
    linear terms so that the basis functions for a predictor are used only when
    the linear term is not sufficient to explain its effect on the outcome.
